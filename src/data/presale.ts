 * Both contracts are verified on Etherscan; the shape of the ABI in
 * src/lib/presaleABI.json is the source of truth for every read and write the
 * site performs.
 *
 * The Sepolia deployment (`ManumitCorePresale`, v0.8.37) prices every accepted
 * ERC-20 through a per-token Chainlink USD feed and the native coin through a
 * native/USD feed. There is no hard-coded token price: `currentTokenPrice(token)`
 * and `currentNativePrice()` return the payment amount owed per whole MMC, and
 * the buy widget mirrors those reads exactly. A token only appears as payable
 * once the owner has registered it with `setPaymentToken(token, true, feed)`.
 *
 * Off-chain payments (BNB, BTC/WBTC, cards and any asset the on-chain sale does
 * not accept directly) are settled by an authorised processor via
 * `recordOffchainPurchase(...)`. The website never calls that function itself —
 * it hands the visitor off to the processor's hosted checkout — so those
 * methods are marked `offchain` below.
